## Notes

There are two types of notes:

- **Deliverable Notes** — Helpful for storing things like Google Drive links, brand feedback, or internal comments.
- **Deal Notes** — Best for broader updates like "Pushed to Q4" or "Awaiting brand approval".

Only the person who wrote a note can edit or delete it.

## Files

Each deal has a **Files** tab where you can upload campaign briefs, drafts, contracts, or anything else related to the project.

---

## AI Integration

Our **Email AI Agent** can:

- **Auto-create deals and deliverables** based on email conversations.
- **Auto-respond to brand inquiries** by referencing existing deals and deliverables on the platform (status updates, links, etc.).

Let the team know if you’d like this configured.

## Other Actions

You can also:

- Edit or delete any deal via the **⋮** menu on the left.
