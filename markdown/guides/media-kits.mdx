## Overview

Eva AI's Media Kits feature automatically generates professional media kits for your talent roster, pulling real-time statistics from Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok every few hours. This eliminates the need to manually create media kits in design tools like Canva and constantly update statistics as your creators' metrics change. Your brand contacts and potential partners always see the most current performance data without any manual work on your end.

## Creating Your First Media Kit

Getting started is straightforward. Click the "Create New Kit" button in the upper right corner of your dashboard. The form that opens asks for basic media kit details and, most importantly, which talent you want to include in the kit. Select all the creators you want featured.

Once you've filled out the details and selected your talent, click "Create Kit" and Eva AI generates your branded media kit automatically. The system pulls the latest statistics from each creator's social media accounts and formats everything into a professional presentation ready for sharing with brands and partners.

## Understanding the Generated Media Kit

When you click "View Details" on your newly created kit, you'll see a comprehensive media kit showcasing all your selected talent with their most current metrics across different social media platforms. The beauty of this system is that these statistics refresh every few hours, so recipients always see accurate, up-to-date performance data rather than outdated numbers that might misrepresent your creators' current reach and engagement.

Each creator appears with their profile information, key metrics, and platform-specific data that gives brands a clear picture of their potential reach and audience engagement. The automated updates mean you never have to worry about presenting stale data that could undermine your pitches or negotiations.

## Customizing Creator Profiles

The media kits offer extensive customization options to ensure each creator is presented in the best possible light. You can update creator avatars by clicking the pencil icon next to their profile picture and uploading a more current or professional image. This is particularly useful when creators update their branding or when you want to maintain consistency across your media kits.

Creator bios are fully editable, allowing you to craft compelling descriptions that highlight their specialties and appeal. For instance, you might describe someone as a "fashion creator" to immediately communicate their niche to potential brand partners. These descriptions help brands quickly understand whether a creator aligns with their target audience and campaign goals.

The tagging system lets you add relevant keywords and categories that make it easy for brands to understand each creator's areas of expertise. You might add tags like "fashion," "lifestyle," or "tech reviews" depending on their content focus.

## Highlighting Brand Collaborations

One of the most powerful features is the ability to showcase previous brand partnerships. When a creator has worked with notable brands that you want to highlight, you can upload those brand logos directly to their profile section. For example, if a creator previously partnered with Alo, you can add the Alo logo to demonstrate their experience with established brands.

This social proof is incredibly valuable when pitching to new brands, as it shows your creators have a track record of successful partnerships and can work professionally with brand guidelines and requirements.

## Platform and Data Configuration

You have complete control over which platforms and metrics appear in your media kits. If a particular campaign or brand partnership only cares about Instagram and TikTok performance, you can disable YouTube data by toggling the platform options. This customization ensures your media kits stay focused and relevant to each specific opportunity.

The data point configuration is equally flexible. You can choose which metrics to display based on what's most relevant to your audience. If total likes and total shares aren't important for a particular pitch, you can toggle them off to keep the media kit clean and focused on the metrics that matter most to that specific brand or campaign.

## Showcasing Past Work

The past work section transforms your media kits from simple statistics sheets into comprehensive portfolios. You can embed actual posts from creators by simply pasting the post URL and clicking "Add." Eva AI automatically embeds the content, creating a visual showcase of the creator's work quality and style.

These embedded posts work across all platforms - TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube content all display properly within the media kit. What makes this particularly engaging is that all embedded content remains playable, so recipients can actually watch or interact with the creator's work directly within the media kit rather than having to visit external platforms.

This feature is invaluable for giving brands a true sense of content quality, production values, and how well a creator's style might align with their brand aesthetic and messaging.

## Visual Customization

Brand consistency matters, and Eva AI's color customization tools ensure your media kits align with your agency's or clients' visual identity. The "Edit Colors" button opens a color theme editor where you can adjust background colors, primary text colors, and other visual elements.

For instance, you might switch to a white background with black primary text for a cleaner, more corporate look, or maintain darker themes for creative agencies that prefer more dynamic presentations. The changes apply immediately, so you can experiment until you find the perfect visual presentation for each client or campaign type.

## Sharing Media Kits

Once your media kit is configured exactly how you want it, sharing is effortless. The share button generates a public link that you can send to brand contacts, campaign managers, or any other stakeholders who need to review your talent roster.

Recipients don't need Eva AI accounts or any special access - they simply click the link and see the complete media kit with all the same configuration options, data points, and embedded content you've set up. This seamless sharing process removes friction from the pitch and approval process, making it easier for brands to evaluate your creators and move forward with partnerships.

## Maintaining and Updating

The automated nature of Eva AI's media kits means your maintenance work is minimal. Statistics update every few hours automatically, so your kits always reflect current performance levels. You only need to update custom elements like creator bios, brand collaboration highlights, or past work showcases when you want to feature new partnerships or content.

This automated updating is particularly valuable during active campaigns when creator metrics might be changing rapidly due to viral content or increased posting frequency. Your media kits stay current without any manual intervention, ensuring you're always presenting the most compelling case for your creators.

## Strategic Applications

These media kits work best when tailored to specific opportunities rather than created as one-size-fits-all documents. Consider creating different versions that highlight different creator strengths, focus on different platforms, or emphasize different types of brand collaborations depending on the pitch.

The combination of real-time data, visual customization, and embedded content creates a powerful tool for demonstrating creator value and building compelling cases for brand partnerships. The automated updates ensure you can focus on strategy and relationship building rather than spending time on manual data compilation and design work.
