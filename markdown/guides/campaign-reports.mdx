## Overview

Eva AI's Campaign Reports feature is designed to help you generate comprehensive analytics reports that bring together performance statistics from multiple posts across your marketing campaigns. Think of it as your central hub for understanding how your campaigns are performing across different platforms and creators. These reports aren't just for internal use either - you can easily share them with external stakeholders like brand managers and campaign managers who need visibility into campaign performance.

The beauty of this feature lies in its ability to automatically collect and aggregate data from TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, giving you a unified view of your campaign's reach and engagement. Rather than manually tracking performance across different platforms and creators, Eva AI does the heavy lifting for you.

## Getting Started with Your First Campaign

Creating a new campaign is straightforward. You'll find the "New Campaign" button in the upper right corner of your dashboard. When you click it, a form opens up where you'll input the essential details that define your campaign.

The campaign name and brand name are pretty self-explanatory, but the start and end dates deserve special attention. These dates are crucial because they determine the time window from which Eva AI will pull analytics data. Here's the key thing to remember: you want to set your date range wider than when you actually expect posts to go live.

![Campaign Date Range Example](/images/guides/campaign-reports/dates.jpg)

For example, let's say you expect your creators to start posting on June 5th and finish by June 10th. You'd want to set your start date before June 5th and your end date after June 10th to ensure you capture all the content. Some users set very broad ranges like July 2024 to December 2025 to make sure they don't miss anything, which works perfectly fine since you can always filter the data later.

Platform selection is another critical step. Eva AI can pull data from TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, but only from the platforms you specifically select during campaign setup. If you don't check Instagram, for instance, any Instagram posts from your campaign simply won't appear in your analytics, even if they use your campaign hashtags. So make sure you select all the platforms where you expect campaign content to appear.

## Understanding Hashtag Configuration

The hashtag section is where you define the criteria for automatically collecting posts into your campaign. This is really important to get right because it determines which posts Eva AI will consider part of your campaign.

![Hashtags Example](/images/guides/campaign-reports/hashtags.jpg)


The rule of thumb is simple: all posts under a given campaign should share at least one common hashtag or caption keyword. So if you're running a tech campaign, you might use something like #FYPAItech as your primary hashtag. You can add multiple hashtags too - maybe you add #fashion if your campaign spans different categories.

What's great is that you're not locked into only the posts that match these criteria. Eva AI also lets you manually add posts that might not fit the automatic criteria but should still be part of your campaign analytics. Maybe there's a YouTube video that doesn't use your hashtag but is clearly part of the campaign - you can simply click the "Add Post" button and include it manually.

## Managing Influencers and Creators

During campaign setup, you'll also select which influencers are participating in your campaign. This step is important because it helps Eva AI organize the analytics and creates those useful creator breakdown views you'll see later. You're not limited to a specific number - select all the creators who are part of your campaign.

## Viewing Your Campaign Analytics

Here's where things get interesting, but there's one thing to keep in mind: when you first create a campaign, the statistics won't be available immediately. Eva AI updates campaign statistics every few hours, so you'll need to check back after some time to see your data populated.

Once your data is available, you'll see a comprehensive dashboard that shows your campaign details alongside aggregated statistics from all the posts Eva AI found for your campaign. The dashboard gives you flexibility in how you view the data - you can see everything together, or filter it down to specific platforms. Want to see only Instagram performance? Just select Instagram from the platform filter. Same goes for YouTube or TikTok.

One of the most valuable features is the performance rankings. Eva AI automatically identifies your top-performing creators based on views and engagement, as well as your top-performing individual posts. For any post, you can click the "View Stats" button to dive deeper into that specific post's performance metrics.

## Working with the Posts and Creator Tab

The Posts tab gives you a comprehensive view of all the individual posts that Eva AI collected for your campaign. This is where the filtering capabilities really shine. You can filter posts based on different performance metrics to focus on what matters most to your analysis.

For instance, if you want to see only posts that received at least 100 likes, you simply input "100" in the likes filter, and Eva AI will show you only posts that meet that threshold. The same filtering works for engagement rate, views, and comments. This makes it easy to identify your top performers or to focus on posts that need attention.

The creator breakdown view is particularly useful for understanding how individual influencers are performing within your campaign. You can see aggregate statistics for each creator, including their total posts, combined views, and average engagement rate across all their campaign content.

## Managing and Editing Campaigns

Campaigns aren't set-and-forget. Eva AI makes it easy to adjust your campaign parameters as needed. The "Edit Campaign" button opens up the same form you used during setup, where you can modify the campaign name, brand name, and hashtag criteria.

Let's say you realize halfway through your campaign that posts are also using #fashion as a hashtag, and you want to capture those too. You can simply edit the campaign, add #fashion to your hashtag list, and Eva AI will include posts with that hashtag in the next analytics update cycle.

Campaign status controls give you flexibility in data collection. You can pause a campaign, which stops Eva AI from updating the data for that particular campaign report. This is useful when your campaign period has ended and you want to freeze the data for final reporting. You can always resume data collection later if needed.

## Sharing Campaign Reports

One of the most powerful features is the ability to share your campaign reports with external stakeholders. When you click the "Share Report" button in the upper right corner, Eva AI generates a public link that you can send to brand managers, campaign managers, or anyone else who needs access to the campaign analytics.

The beauty of this sharing feature is that recipients don't need Eva AI accounts or any special access. They can simply click the link and see the same statistics, data points, and analytics that you see in your dashboard. This makes it incredibly easy to keep stakeholders informed about campaign performance without having to create custom reports or presentations.

## Best Practices for Success

Getting the most out of Eva AI's Campaign Reports feature comes down to thoughtful setup and regular monitoring. When setting up campaigns, err on the side of broader date ranges rather than narrow ones. It's easier to filter out data later than to miss posts because your date range was too restrictive.

Hashtag strategy is crucial for automatic post collection. Work with your creators to ensure they're using consistent hashtags, and don't forget that you can always add posts manually if they don't fit your automatic criteria.


Regular monitoring helps you catch any issues early. Since analytics update every few hours, check back periodically to ensure your campaign is collecting the posts you expect. Use the filtering tools to focus your analysis on the metrics that matter most to your specific campaign goals.

When it comes to sharing reports, take advantage of the public link feature to keep stakeholders engaged throughout the campaign rather than waiting until the end. Real-time access to performance data helps everyone make better decisions as the campaign progresses.

## Technical Considerations

Eva AI's analytics engine updates every few hours, so plan accordingly when you need fresh data. The system currently supports TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, with data collection based on your specified date ranges and hashtag matching criteria. While the automatic collection is quite sophisticated, the manual post addition feature ensures you never miss important content that might not fit the standard criteria.

Remember that pausing a campaign stops data updates entirely, so use this feature thoughtfully when you want to freeze your data for final reporting or analysis.
